# Revista Seareiro Assinatura (Seareiro magazine assignature)

**Made in: HTML / CSS / JS / PHP**

Website created as a freelancing service for an small magazine service in SÃ£o Paulo, SP - Brazil, they already had a principal website but needed a website to their new signature service. It was done mostly in HTML/CSS and JS using PHP for componentization, the layout of the site was also developed by me using Figma software.
